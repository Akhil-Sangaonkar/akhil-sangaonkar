# Project Overview

This repository contains the key files for my personal portfolio website, which talks about my background, resume, machine learning projects and photography work. Below is a detailed description of each file:

### 1. `index.html`
The `index.html` file is the homepage of the website. It introduces the content and provides navigation to various sections, including the "About Me" page, Resume, Machine Learning Projects and Photography. 

### 2. `resume.html`
The `resume.html` page contains a detailed view of my professional background, including education, work experience, skills and notable achievements. 

### 3. `ml-projects.html`
This file is for my machine learning projects. Each project is described with relevant details, highlighting the techniques used, datasets and outcomes. 

### 4. `photography.html`
The `photography.html` page highlights my passion for photography. It includes a curated selection of images that demonstrate my skills in capturing visual stories. 



## Future Enhancements

I plan to regularly update the content of the website with new projects in machine learning and photography as well as further improve the overall layout and design.
