        <p class="lead text-center">Data Scientist | ML Engineer | Photographer</p>
        <p>
            My passion for mathematics, a topic that has always captivated me with its beauty and logical structure, was the foundation of my path. With the help of this desire, which ignited my ambition, I was able to secure admission to one of India's top-ranked and competitive universities, IIT Madras for Aerospace Engineering, with an incredible 99.31 percentile. The demanding curriculum sharpened my analytical abilities and exposed me to the complexities of tackling problems in a highly technical subject as well as complex systems.
        </p>
        <p>
            I found that, while engaged in my academics, photography was a creative escape. A basic leisure activity rapidly developed into a deep interest, especially for landscape photography. My approach of expressing my creativity and enjoying the world around me has been to capture the beauty of nature. A landscape's blend of hues, light, and shadows may convey a story that numbers alone are unable to express. This insight opened a new chapter in my life, combining my creative and technical interests.
        </p>
        <p>
            As I explored more into the wide world of photography, I started to see connections between the analytical and the artistic side of myself. My route towards data science—a topic that flawlessly combines my interests—was started by this relationship. I came to see machine learning as a logical extension of my passion for mathematics, given its mathematical foundations. I can use data science to use mathematical ideas to address practical issues and get new perspectives, much as how I examine a situation to take a striking picture.        </p>
        <p>
            I just wrapped up  with a master's degree in computational statistics and machine learning at University College London, where I developed advanced abilities in data analysis methods, machine learning algorithms, and statistical modelling. I focused on using these ideas in practical settings throughout the curriculum, strengthening my problem-solving skills via collaborative tasks. My education has improved my comprehension of the theoretical foundations of data science and given me the ability to tackle challenging issues from a sensitive position. My dissertation, which further demonstrates my proficiency in the subject, has also been submitted.
        </p>
        <p>
            Today, I am excited to integrate my creative sensibility with my technical skills . I firmly think that data tells stories, and I'm dedicated to using my profession to find those stories. My objective is to provide memorable experiences that captivate people, whether it is via the creation of innovative machine learning models or the photography of stunning landscapes. As I continue to investigate the connections between data, creativity, and narrative, I warmly welcome you to my profile.        </p>
